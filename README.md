## My Programming Knowledge

- I consider myself fluent in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
  - Thanks to my JavaScript knowledge, I also know a bit of Java and TypeScript.
- I know my way around the extensions API for both Chrome and VS Code.
- I've made a couple Minecraft mods (Fabric/Forge loaders). [Check them out](https://modrinth.com/user/AdamRaichu)

## My Contributions to Community Projects

I am the author of the [highlight.js](https://github.com/highlightjs) [grammar for Minecraft's language files](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlightjs-lang).

I [authored/updated descriptions](https://github.com/github/explore/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+author%3Aadamraichu) for several GitHub topics.

I've helped find errors in the [Minecraft Bedrock documentation](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/minecraft-creator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated-desc+author%3Aadamraichu+).

I try to help authors of popular VS Code extensions make them compatible with the web. (See below)

- [GitHub Actions for VS Code](https://github.com/github/vscode-github-actions/pull/20)
- [Snowstorm](https://github.com/JannisX11/snowstorm/pull/61)

## VS Code Extensions

I have written a few extensions for the popular code editor Visual Studio Code. View them [on the marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/AdamRaichu) or at [this repo](https://github.com/AdamRaichu/vscode-extensions) _(possibly outdated; I don't update this repo that much)_ about them.
